jantonisito: Can you critique my code?

GitHub Copilot: Your code is generally well-written and follows Go's idiomatic style. Here are a few points of critique:

1. **Comments**: Your comments are clear and concise, which is good. However, the comment on line 45 could be more descriptive. Instead of saying "strictly speaking not necessary", you could explain why you're rounding to two decimal places.

2. **Error Handling**: In the `Age` function, if the planet does not exist in the `yearRatio` map, you return `-1.0`. This is a magic number and might not be immediately clear to other developers. Consider returning an error instead.

3. **Variable Initialization**: On line 42, you initialize `age` to `0.0`. This is unnecessary because `age` is immediately assigned a new value if the planet exists in the `yearRatio` map.

4. **Constants**: The `EarthYrSecs` constant is not defined in this code snippet. Make sure it's defined elsewhere in your code. If it's not, you should define it.

Here's how you might revise your code:

```go
// EarthYrSecs is the number of seconds in an Earth year
const EarthYrSecs = 31557600

// Age returns age on planet in local years given age in secs and the Planet type.
// Returns an error if the planet is not found.
func Age(ageInSeconds float64, planet Planet) (float64, error) {
	if ratio, exists := yearRatio[planet]; exists {
		age := (ageInSeconds / EarthYrSecs) / ratio
		// rounding to 2 digits for precision
		return math.Round(age*100) / 100.0, nil
	}
	return 0, fmt.Errorf("planet %v not found", planet)
}
```

This version of `Age` returns an error when the planet is not found, which makes error handling more explicit.
