jantonisito: Tell me about the error handling in Go

GitHub Copilot: In Go, error handling is done explicitly. Errors are the last return value from a function and they are of the built-in `error` type. A nil value indicates that there was no error.

In the provided code, the `Distance` function returns two values: an integer and an error. If the lengths of the input strings are not equal, the function returns `-1` and an error created by `errors.New("strings must have equal length to be compared")`. If there is no error (i.e., the strings are of equal length), the function returns the Hamming distance and `nil` for the error.

This approach to error handling allows the caller to decide how to handle errors. They can check if an error occurred by comparing the error to `nil`, and handle it appropriately.

jantonisito: OK I am reading docs for package errors
Can you explain Unwrap?

GitHub Copilot: Sure, `Unwrap` is a function provided by the `errors` package in Go. It is used to retrieve the next error in error chain.

Here's how it works:

If an error has been wrapped using `fmt.Errorf` with `%w`, you can retrieve the original error using `errors.Unwrap(err)`. This is useful when you want to check if an error is of a certain type.

Here's an example:

```go
package main

import (
	"errors"
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	err := fmt.Errorf("an error occurred: %w", errors.New("original error"))
	fmt.Println(err) // prints: an error occurred: original error

	unwrappedErr := errors.Unwrap(err)
	fmt.Println(unwrappedErr) // prints: original error
}
```

In this example, `errors.Unwrap(err)` returns the original error that was wrapped by `fmt.Errorf`.

If the error does not have a next error to unwrap, `Unwrap` returns `nil`.

jantonisito: and what if `Errorf` used several errors? We will get a slice?

GitHub Copilot: No, `Errorf` does not return a slice of errors, even if multiple errors are used in the formatting string. It returns a single error that contains the formatted string.

If you use the `%w` verb with multiple errors, only the last one will be available through `errors.Unwrap`. This is because `%w` is intended to wrap a single underlying error with additional context, not to aggregate multiple errors.

Here's an example:

```go
package main

import (
	"errors"
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	err1 := errors.New("first error")
	err2 := errors.New("second error")
	err := fmt.Errorf("an error occurred: %w, then another error: %w", err1, err2)
	fmt.Println(err) // prints: an error occurred: first error, then another error: second error

	unwrappedErr := errors.Unwrap(err)
	fmt.Println(unwrappedErr) // prints: second error
}
```

In this example, `errors.Unwrap(err)` only returns the second error, not the first one. If you need to handle multiple errors, you might want to consider using a custom error type that can hold multiple errors.

jantonisito: How can I create a custom error type in Go to handle multiple errors?

GitHub Copilot: To create a custom error type in Go that can handle multiple errors, you can define a new type that implements the `error` interface. The `error` interface requires a method `Error() string`.

Here's an example of a custom error type that can hold multiple errors:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"strings"
)

// MultiError type for handling multiple errors
type MultiError struct {
	Errors []error
}

// Error method to implement the error interface
func (m *MultiError) Error() string {
	errs := make([]string, len(m.Errors))
	for i, err := range m.Errors {
		errs[i] = err.Error()
	}
	return strings.Join(errs, ", ")
}

func main() {
	errs := []error{
		fmt.Errorf("first error"),
		fmt.Errorf("second error"),
	}
	multiErr := &MultiError{Errors: errs}
	fmt.Println(multiErr.Error()) // prints: first error, second error
}
```

In this example, `MultiError` is a struct that holds a slice of errors. It implements the `error` interface by defining an `Error` method that joins the error messages of all the errors it holds.

jantonisito: explain

```
type MultiError struct {
    Errors []error
}
```

GitHub Copilot: This is a declaration of a new type in Go called `MultiError`. It's a struct that has one field, `Errors`, which is a slice of `error` objects.

A struct in Go is a collection of fields. In this case, `MultiError` has just one field, `Errors`, but it could have more if needed.

The `error` type is an interface type. A slice of `error` means that you can store multiple `error` values in the `Errors` field.

This `MultiError` type can be used to aggregate multiple errors into one. This is useful in situations where a function might encounter several errors that it needs to return. Instead of returning just the first error it encounters, it can store all of them in a `MultiError` and return that. The caller can then inspect all the errors and handle them as necessary.

jantonisito: Canyou elaborate on `error` being interface - I see in docs:
type error interface {
Error() string
}
what does it mean?

GitHub Copilot: In Go, an interface is a type that defines a set of methods. Any type that implements those methods satisfies the interface.

The `error` interface is a built-in type in Go, and it's very simple. It requires just one method: `Error() string`. This means that any type that has a method named `Error` that returns a string satisfies the `error` interface.

Here's an example of a custom error type:

```go
type MyError struct {
	message string
}

func (e *MyError) Error() string {
	return e.message
}
```

In this example, `MyError` is a struct with a `message` field. It has a method `Error` that returns the `message` field as a string. Because `MyError` has this method, it satisfies the `error` interface. You can return a `MyError` from a function that returns an `error`.

This is how Go handles errors in a flexible way. You can create custom error types with additional information and methods, and as long as they have an `Error() string` method, they can be used wherever an `error` is expected.

jantonisito: OK I understand the concept of interface imposing requirement that the function Error() returning string is defined. But us rhere ACTUAL implementation of `error`?

GitHub Copilot: The `error` type in Go is an interface, and by itself, it doesn't have an implementation. It's a contract that specifies that any type that has an `Error() string` method is an `error`.

However, the Go standard library provides a concrete implementation of the `error` interface in the `errors` package. This is the `errors.New` function, which returns an `error` that simply contains a string. Here's what it looks like:

```go
// The New function from the errors package
func New(text string) error {
	return &errorString{text}
}

// errorString is a trivial implementation of error.
type errorString struct {
	s string
}

func (e *errorString) Error() string {
	return e.s
}
```

In this code, `errorString` is a struct that implements the `error` interface. It has a single field `s` for the error message, and an `Error` method that returns the message. The `New` function creates an `errorString` with the given text and returns it as an `error`.

So when you call `errors.New("some error")`, you're getting an `error` that's actually an `errorString` underneath. But because `errorString` implements the `error` interface, it can be used wherever an `error` is expected.

jantonisito: Ok so if I am reading it correctly... there is a built-in type `errorString` that implements `error` interface. There is also function a helper function new `New` defined in package `eerors` and therefore called with signature like `errors.New(...)` that returns pointer to `errorString` object. The fact that we called that function `New` is incidental. There is no "contract" to fulfill.

GitHub Copilot: Yes, you've got it right. The `errorString` type is a simple implementation of the `error` interface provided by the Go standard library. The `errors.New` function is a convenient way to create new errors of this type.

The name `New` is indeed incidental. It's a convention in Go to name a function that creates and returns a new instance of a type `New`. This function usually takes the necessary parameters to initialize the new instance. But there's no requirement or "contract" that every type must have a `New` function. It's just a common pattern that you'll see in many Go packages.

jantonisito: can you unpack for me what is happening insinde `New` - is it a case of "auto-vivification" that `errorString` object (which more less is a wrapper around simple string ) is created and returned?

GitHub Copilot: Yes, you're correct. The `errors.New` function in Go is a simple function that creates a new instance of `errorString` and returns it as an `error`.

Here's what happens when you call `errors.New("some error")`:

1. A new instance of `errorString` is created with the provided string. This is done by the `&errorString{text}` expression. The `&` operator creates a pointer to a new `errorString` instance.

2. This new `errorString` instance is returned from the function. Because `errorString` implements the `error` interface (it has an `Error() string` method), it can be returned as an `error`.

This is not "auto-vivification" in the sense that term is used in languages like Perl, where accessing a complex data structure like a hash or array automatically creates it if it doesn't exist. Instead, it's just a simple function that creates a new object and returns it. The `New` function doesn't check if an `errorString` with the same text already exists or anything like that. Each call to `New` creates a new `errorString` instance.

jantonisito: How can I check if an error is of a specific type in Go?

GitHub Copilot: In Go, you can check if an error is of a specific type using a type assertion or the `errors.As` function.

Here's an example using a type assertion:

```go
if myErr, ok := err.(*MyError); ok {
    // err is of type *MyError, and myErr is its value
}
```

In this code, `err.(*MyError)` is a type assertion. It checks if `err` is of type `*MyError`. If `err` is of this type, `ok` will be `true` and `myErr` will be the value of `err` cast to `*MyError`.

Here's an example using `errors.As`:

```go
var myErr *MyError
if errors.As(err, &myErr) {
    // err is of type *MyError, and myErr is its value
}
```

In this code, `errors.As(err, &myErr)` checks if `err` is of type `*MyError` or if `err` wraps an error of type `*MyError`. If so, it sets `myErr` to the error and returns `true`.

Both of these methods can be used to check if an error is of a specific type, but `errors.As` can also handle wrapped errors. If you're dealing with errors that might be wrapped using `fmt.Errorf` or `errors.Wrap`, you should use `errors.As`.

jantonisito: How can I handle different types of errors in a Go program?

GitHub Copilot: In Go, you can handle different types of errors using a combination of type assertions, the `errors.As` function, and the `errors.Is` function.

Here's an example of how you might handle different types of errors:

```go
err := someFunctionThatReturnsAnError()
if err != nil {
    if errors.Is(err, io.EOF) {
        // handle EOF error
    } else if myErr, ok := err.(*MyError); ok {
        // handle *MyError
    } else if otherErr, ok := err.(*OtherError); ok {
        // handle *OtherError
    } else {
        // handle unknown error
    }
}
```

In this code:

- `errors.Is(err, io.EOF)` checks if `err` is `io.EOF` or if `err` wraps `io.EOF`.
- `err.(*MyError)` is a type assertion that checks if `err` is of type `*MyError`.
- `err.(*OtherError)` is another type assertion that checks if `err` is of type `*OtherError`.

Each of these checks allows you to handle a specific type of error. If none of the checks match, the code falls through to the `else` clause, which handles unknown errors.

This is a simple example, but in a real program, you might have more complex error handling logic. You might also use `errors.As` to handle errors that wrap other errors.

jantonisito: I presume that (like with other type of objects) there is no inheritance when it comes to errors. But You can build more complex tyoe of custom errors by composing them from simpler types and using `Is` and `As` funtions? Can interface mechanism be used to express inheritance?

GitHub Copilot: Correct, Go does not have traditional inheritance like some other object-oriented languages. Instead, Go uses interfaces for polymorphism and composition to build complex types from simpler ones.

For errors, you can indeed build more complex types by composing them from simpler types. You can also use the `errors.Is` and `errors.As` functions to check if an error is of a certain type or wraps a certain type.

Interfaces in Go can be used to express a form of inheritance. If a type implements all the methods of an interface, it is said to satisfy that interface. This is similar to a class in other languages inheriting from a base class and thus having all its methods. However, it's not inheritance in the traditional sense because there's no "is-a" relationship. A type that satisfies an interface in Go simply has all the methods that the interface requires, but it doesn't "inherit" from the interface.

For example, you could define a `CustomError` interface with additional methods beyond the standard `Error() string` method:

```go
type CustomError interface {
    error
    CustomMethod() string
}
```

Any type that implements both `Error() string` and `CustomMethod() string` would satisfy the `CustomError` interface. This is a way to create more complex error types with additional behavior.

jantonisito: How can I create a custom error type that wraps an existing error in Go?

GitHub Copilot: In Go, you can create a custom error type that wraps an existing error by defining a struct that includes a field for the wrapped error and implementing the `error` interface. Here's an example:

```go
type MyError struct {
    Msg string
    Err error
}

func (e *MyError) Error() string {
    return e.Msg + ": " + e.Err.Error()
}

func (e *MyError) Unwrap() error {
    return e.Err
}
```

In this example, `MyError` is a struct with two fields: `Msg` for a custom error message, and `Err` for the wrapped error.

The `Error` method returns a string that includes both the custom message and the message of the wrapped error. This method makes `MyError` satisfy the `error` interface.

The `Unwrap` method returns the wrapped error. This method allows functions like `errors.As` and `errors.Is` to examine the wrapped error.

You can use this custom error type like this:

```go
func someFunction() error {
    if err := someOtherFunction(); err != nil {
        return &MyError{
            Msg: "something went wrong in someFunction",
            Err: err,
        }
    }
    return nil
}
```

In this code, if `someOtherFunction` returns an error, `someFunction` wraps that error in a `MyError` and returns it. The caller of `someFunction` can then use `errors.As` or `errors.Is` to check if the returned error is a `MyError` or the type of the wrapped error.

jantonisito: How can I handle multiple errors returned from different functions in Go?

GitHub Copilot: In Go, you can handle multiple errors returned from different functions by checking each error individually. Here's an example:

```go
func someFunction() error {
    err1 := functionThatReturnsError1()
    if err1 != nil {
        return fmt.Errorf("error from function 1: %w", err1)
    }

    err2 := functionThatReturnsError2()
    if err2 != nil {
        return fmt.Errorf("error from function 2: %w", err2)
    }

    // ... more functions that might return errors

    return nil
}
```

In this code, `someFunction` calls two functions that might return errors: `functionThatReturnsError1` and `functionThatReturnsError2`. After each call, it checks if the function returned an error. If so, it wraps the error with a custom message using `fmt.Errorf` and returns it.

The `%w` verb in the format string of `fmt.Errorf` is a placeholder for the error. It wraps the error, which allows the caller of `someFunction` to use `errors.As` or `errors.Is` to check if the returned error is, or wraps, a specific error.

This is a simple example, but in a real program, you might have more complex error handling logic. You might also handle the errors in different ways depending on their type or other conditions.

jantonisito: OK but in this case I KNOW that function is returning wrapped error because I can see that return parts uses `fmt.Errorf` - therefore I will uses `errors.As` - but in general case I cant really tell what will be returened - wrapped or unwrapped err.

GitHub Copilot: You're correct. In general, when you're calling a function that returns an error, you can't know for sure whether the error will be a simple error or a wrapped error. This is why the `errors.As` and `errors.Is` functions are so useful.

`errors.As` will unwrap the error recursively until it finds an error that can be assigned to the target, or until it finds no more wrapped errors. This means that it can handle both simple and wrapped errors.

`errors.Is` will unwrap the error recursively until it finds a match, or until it finds no more wrapped errors. This means that it can handle both simple and wrapped errors.

So, even if you don't know whether an error is wrapped or not, you can still use `errors.As` and `errors.Is` to check for specific errors. This is a good practice because it makes your error handling code more robust and able to handle errors from functions that might change how they return errors in the future.

jantonisito: I am not sure I see a diffe betwee the two functions - can you provide me with an example?

GitHub Copilot: Sure, let's consider an example where we have a base error and a custom error that wraps the base error:

```go
var ErrBase = errors.New("base error")

type CustomError struct {
    Err error
}

func (e *CustomError) Error() string {
    return fmt.Sprintf("custom: %v", e.Err)
}

func (e *CustomError) Unwrap() error {
    return e.Err
}

func someFunction() error {
    return &CustomError{ErrBase}
}
```

In this code, `someFunction` returns a `CustomError` that wraps `ErrBase`.

Now, let's see how `errors.As` and `errors.Is` behave:

```go
err := someFunction()

var customErr *CustomError
if errors.As(err, &customErr) {
    fmt.Println("errors.As found a CustomError")
} else {
    fmt.Println("errors.As did not find a CustomError")
}

if errors.Is(err, ErrBase) {
    fmt.Println("errors.Is found ErrBase")
} else {
    fmt.Println("errors.Is did not find ErrBase")
}
```

In this code:

- `errors.As(err, &customErr)` checks if `err` is, or wraps, a `CustomError`. It returns `true` because `err` is a `CustomError`.
- `errors.Is(err, ErrBase)` checks if `err` is, or wraps, `ErrBase`. It returns `true` because `err` wraps `ErrBase`.

So, `errors.As` is used to check if an error is of a specific type, and `errors.Is` is used to check if an error is a specific instance. Both can handle wrapped errors.

jantonisito: but `errors.Is(err, CustomError)` would also return `true`?

GitHub Copilot: No, `errors.Is(err, CustomError)` would not return `true`. The `errors.Is` function checks for equality, not type. It checks if an error is a specific instance of an error, not if it's of a specific type.

In the example, `errors.Is(err, ErrBase)` returns `true` because `err` wraps `ErrBase`, which is a specific error instance. If you tried to use `errors.Is(err, CustomError)`, it would return `false` unless `err` was exactly `CustomError`, not just an error of type `CustomError`.

To check if an error is of a specific type, you should use `errors.As`. For example, `errors.As(err, &customErr)` checks if `err` is, or wraps, an error of type `CustomError`.

Here's an example to illustrate the difference:

```go
baseErr := errors.New("base error")
customErr := &CustomError{baseErr}

err := customErr

fmt.Println(errors.Is(err, baseErr))  // prints: true
fmt.Println(errors.Is(err, customErr)) // prints: true

var asCustomErr *CustomError
fmt.Println(errors.As(err, &asCustomErr)) // prints: true

var asBaseErr = &errors.errorString{}
fmt.Println(errors.As(err, &asBaseErr)) // prints: false
```

In this code:

- `errors.Is(err, baseErr)` returns `true` because `err` wraps `baseErr`.
- `errors.Is(err, customErr)` returns `true` because `err` is exactly `customErr`.
- `errors.As(err, &asCustomErr)` returns `true` because `err` is of type `*CustomError`.
- `errors.As(err, &asBaseErr)` returns `false` because `err` is not of type `*errors.errorString`.

jantonisito: Yeah - you are absolutely right - did not read it carefully enough.

GitHub Copilot: No problem at all! Understanding error handling in Go, especially with the `errors.Is` and `errors.As` functions, can be a bit tricky at first. If you have any more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!

jantonisito: So the last case - let me double check it - you said previouslu that `errors.As(err, &BaseErr)` will check if `err` is is or wraps `BaseErr` - it is not `BaseErr` and it was not "wrapped" by `fmt.Errorf` but `CustomError` contains `BaseErr` - but that is not "wrapping" - correct?

GitHub Copilot: Correct, in Go, when we say an error "wraps" another error, we typically mean that the error was created with `fmt.Errorf` and the `%w` verb, or that the error type has an `Unwrap` method that returns the wrapped error.

In the `CustomError` example, `CustomError` does indeed contain `ErrBase`, and it also has an `Unwrap` method that returns the contained error. This means that `CustomError` "wraps" `ErrBase` in the sense used by `errors.As` and `errors.Is`.

So, if you have a `CustomError` instance and you call `errors.As(err, &baseErr)`, where `err` is the `CustomError` instance and `baseErr` is a variable of the same type as `ErrBase`, `errors.As` will return `true` because `CustomError` wraps `ErrBase`.

Here's an example:

```go
var ErrBase = errors.New("base error")

type CustomError struct {
    Err error
}

func (e *CustomError) Error() string {
    return fmt.Sprintf("custom: %v", e.Err)
}

func (e *CustomError) Unwrap() error {
    return e.Err
}

func someFunction() error {
    return &CustomError{ErrBase}
}

func main() {
    err := someFunction()

    var baseErr *errors.errorString
    if errors.As(err, &baseErr) {
        fmt.Println("errors.As found ErrBase")
    } else {
        fmt.Println("errors.As did not find ErrBase")
    }
}
```

In this code, `errors.As(err, &baseErr)` returns `true` because `err` is a `CustomError` that wraps `ErrBase`.

jantonisito: Ah! Important clarification! Thank you!

GitHub Copilot: You're welcome! I'm glad I could help clarify that for you. If you have any more questions about error handling in Go or anything else, feel free to ask!
