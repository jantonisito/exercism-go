jantonisito: can you critique my code?

GitHub Copilot: Your code is generally well-written and does its job of reversing a string. However, there are a few points that could be improved:

1. **Comment Placement**: The comment `//Reverse reverses string param` should be placed directly above the function declaration, not inside the function body. This is the standard Go convention for documenting functions.

2. **Variable Naming**: The variable `last` could be renamed to something more descriptive, like `length` or `runesLength`, to make the code more readable.

3. **Error Handling**: While your function handles empty strings, it does not handle other edge cases, such as null input.

4. **Efficiency**: Your code creates a new slice and copies the runes from the input string into it in reverse order. This is not the most efficient way to reverse a string in Go. You could instead swap the runes in place, which would be more memory efficient.

Here's how you could implement these suggestions:

```go
package reverse

// Reverse reverses the input string
func Reverse(input string) string {
	if input == "" {
		return input
	}

	runes := []rune(input)
	length := len(runes)

	for i := 0; i < length/2; i++ {
		runes[i], runes[length-1-i] = runes[length-1-i], runes[i]
	}

	return string(runes)
}
```

This version of the function swaps the runes in place, which is more memory efficient. It also handles the case where the input is an empty string.

jantonisito: so what happens for `length` being odd

GitHub Copilot: When the `length` of the string (number of runes) is odd, the middle character remains in its place. This is because the loop runs `length/2` times, which in the case of an odd length, will be a number less than half the length due to integer division.

For example, if the string is "abc", the length is 3, and `length/2` is 1 (integer division). So the loop will run once, swapping the first and last characters, resulting in "cba". The middle character "b" remains in its place because it was not part of the swap operation.

This is the expected behavior when reversing a string. The characters at the ends of the string move towards the center, and if there is a middle character, it stays in place.

jantonisito: this is really neat - thanks

GitHub Copilot: You're welcome! If you have any other questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask. Happy coding!

jantonisito: Of course this depends if we want to reverse in place or create a copy

GitHub Copilot: Yes, you're correct. The approach to reverse a string can vary based on whether you want to modify the original string in place or create a reversed copy of it.

The code I provided earlier creates a reversed copy of the input string. This is because strings in Go are immutable, so you can't change their characters in place. Instead, you have to create a new string with the reversed characters.

If you were working with a mutable type, like a slice of runes, you could reverse it in place by swapping the elements without creating a new slice. Here's how you could do that:

```go
runes := []rune("Hello, World!")
length := len(runes)

for i := 0; i < length/2; i++ {
    runes[i], runes[length-1-i] = runes[length-1-i], runes[i]
}
```

In this code, `runes` is a slice of runes, which is mutable. The loop swaps each rune with its mirror image in the slice, effectively reversing the slice in place.

jantonisito: Actually I take it back - we already create new slice `rune` - so you were correct - creating yet another one `reverse` is not necessary

GitHub Copilot: Yes, you're correct. In the provided Go code, we first convert the string to a slice of runes. This is necessary because strings in Go are immutable, but slices are mutable. Once we have a slice of runes, we can reverse it in place without creating another slice. Here's the code again for reference:

```go
func Reverse(input string) string {
    runes := []rune(input)
    length := len(runes)

    for i := 0; i < length/2; i++ {
        runes[i], runes[length-1-i] = runes[length-1-i], runes[i]
    }

    return string(runes)
}
```

In this code, `runes` is a slice that contains the runes of the input string. The loop swaps each rune with its mirror image in the slice, effectively reversing the slice in place. The reversed slice is then converted back to a string and returned. This approach is efficient because it only creates one new slice and does not require additional memory for another slice.

jantonisito: it is a bit couterintuitive with `i < length/2` vs `i <= length/2` because of zero indexing

GitHub Copilot: The condition `i < length/2` is used to ensure that the loop only iterates over the first half of the slice. This is because in each iteration, the loop is swapping two elements: one from the first half and one from the second half.

If we used `i <= length/2` instead, the loop would go one step too far in the case of an even-length slice and re-swap the middle two elements back to their original positions, which is not what we want.

Here's a step-by-step explanation using the string "abcd" as an example:

1. In the first iteration (`i = 0`), the first and last characters are swapped, resulting in "dbcd".
2. In the second iteration (`i = 1`), the second and second-to-last characters are swapped, resulting in "dcba".
3. If the loop continued for a third iteration (`i = 2`), it would re-swap the middle two characters back to their original positions, resulting in "dbca".

So, `i < length/2` is the correct condition to use in this case, even though it might seem counterintuitive due to zero indexing.

jantonisito: but the gain in performance is undeniable:
For first approach - with extra `reverse`  
1895503 534.9 ns/op 152 B/op 5 allocs/op  
whereas your solution:  
4447509 274.3 ns/op 0 B/op 0 allocs/op

GitHub Copilot: Indeed, the performance difference between the two approaches is significant.

The first approach, which creates an extra `reverse` slice, has a higher time complexity and memory usage. It performs 5 allocations, resulting in 152 bytes per operation, and takes 534.9 nanoseconds per operation.

The second approach, which reverses the slice in place, is more efficient. It performs no allocations, resulting in 0 bytes per operation, and takes only 274.3 nanoseconds per operation.

This demonstrates the importance of choosing the right approach when writing code. Even small optimizations can lead to significant performance improvements, especially in programs that need to process large amounts of data or run operations frequently.
