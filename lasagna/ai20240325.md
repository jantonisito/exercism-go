GitHub Copilot: Your code is clean, well-structured, and follows good practices. Here are a few minor suggestions:

1. **Comments**: Your comments are clear and explain the purpose of the functions well. However, Go has a convention where the comments for exported functions (those starting with a capital letter) should start with the function name. For example, the comment for `RemainingOvenTime` could be "RemainingOvenTime returns the remaining minutes based on the `actual` minutes already in the oven."

2. **Constant Naming**: In Go, constants are usually named in CamelCase, not PascalCase. So `OvenTime` is more idiomatic than `OVEN_TIME`.

3. **Error Handling**: Your functions assume that the input will always be valid (e.g., the number of layers and actual minutes in the oven will always be non-negative). Depending on the context where these functions are used, you might want to add error handling to deal with invalid inputs.

4. **Tests**: It's always a good idea to write tests for your functions to make sure they work as expected. You could write tests to check the output of your functions given certain inputs.

Remember, these are minor suggestions and your code is already quite good!
