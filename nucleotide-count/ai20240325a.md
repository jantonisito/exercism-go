jantonisito: could you explain the following code:

```
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("start")
    funcWithRecover()
    fmt.Println("stop")
}

func funcWithRecover() {
    defer func() {
    if r := recover(); r != nil {
      fmt.Printf("Panic: %+v\n", r)
    }
  }()
    panic("panic in funcWithRecover")
}
```

GitHub Copilot: This is a Go program that demonstrates the use of the `panic` and `recover` functions for error handling.

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. The `main` function is the entry point of the program. It first prints "start" to the console.

2. It then calls `funcWithRecover`. Inside `funcWithRecover`, a `defer` statement is used. `defer` ensures that the function provided is executed after `funcWithRecover` finishes, regardless of how it finishes (normally or due to a panic).

3. The deferred function uses `recover`, which stops the panic and returns the value that was passed to `panic`. If there's no ongoing panic, `recover` returns `nil`.

4. If `recover` returns a non-nil value (indicating a panic occurred), it prints "Panic: " followed by the panic value.

5. After the `defer` statement, `funcWithRecover` intentionally triggers a panic with the message "panic in funcWithRecover". This panic is caught by the `recover` function in the deferred function.

6. After `funcWithRecover` finishes (due to the panic), control returns to `main`, which then prints "stop" to the console.

So, the output of this program would be:

```
start
Panic: panic in funcWithRecover
stop
```

jantonisito: I am not sure I completely understamd - there is `panic` that happems inside `funcWithRecovery` so then `r` is not set to `nil` and that deferred block happens before panic message is printed. Is that the gist of it?

GitHub Copilot: Yes, you've got the main idea. Here's a bit more detail:

1. When `panic("panic in funcWithRecover")` is called inside `funcWithRecover`, it immediately stops execution of the current function and begins to unwind the stack (this is the "panic").

2. However, before Go unwinds the stack, it checks for any deferred functions. If there are any, it executes them.

3. In this case, there is a deferred function which calls `recover()`. `recover()` stops the panic and returns the value that was passed to `panic()`. In this case, it returns the string "panic in funcWithRecover".

4. The deferred function then checks if `r` (the result of `recover()`) is `nil`. If `r` is not `nil`, it means a panic occurred and was recovered. The function then prints "Panic: " followed by the value of `r` (the panic message).

5. After the deferred function finishes executing, `funcWithRecover` has finished executing (due to the panic), so control returns to the `main` function.

6. `main` then prints "stop" and finishes executing.

So, the `defer` statement with `recover` inside `funcWithRecover` serves as a way to catch and handle the panic, allowing the program to continue executing instead of crashing.

jantonisito: Ahhh - so technically `main` can go on?

GitHub Copilot: Yes, exactly. The `recover` function stops the panic and allows the program to continue executing. In this case, after the panic in `funcWithRecover` is recovered, control returns to the `main` function, which then prints "stop" and finishes executing. Without the `recover` function, the panic would cause the program to crash.

jantonisito: Nice. Thank you.

GitHub Copilot: You're welcome! If you have any more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask. Happy coding!
