jantonisito: how do I get time duration properly formatted - years, days, hrs, mins secs?

GitHub Copilot: To get a time duration properly formatted in years, days, hours, minutes, and seconds, you can use the `time.Duration` type in Go. However, the `time.Duration` type does not directly support years and days because the length of a year and a day can vary. You can calculate them manually based on the assumption that a year is 365.25 days (to account for leap years) and a day is 24 hours.

Here's a function that takes a `time.Duration` and returns a string formatted as years, days, hours, minutes, and seconds:

```go
func formatDuration(d time.Duration) string {
    const (
        Day   = time.Hour * 24
        Year  = Day * 365.25
    )

    years := int(d / Year)
    d -= time.Duration(years) * Year

    days := int(d / Day)
    d -= time.Duration(days) * Day

    hours := int(d / time.Hour)
    d -= time.Duration(hours) * time.Hour

    minutes := int(d / time.Minute)
    d -= time.Duration(minutes) * time.Minute

    seconds := int(d / time.Second)

    return fmt.Sprintf("%d years, %d days, %d hours, %d minutes, %d seconds", years, days, hours, minutes, seconds)
}
```

You can use this function to format the elapsed time in your main function:

```go
fmt.Println(formatDuration(elapsed))
```

jantonisito: don't you have to specify type for Year?

GitHub Copilot: In Go, when you declare a constant with a type, all the constants in the same parentheses will have the same type. In your code, `Day` and `Year` are both of type `time.Duration` because `Day` is declared with `time.Hour * 24`, which is of type `time.Duration`.

Here's the relevant part of your code:

```go
const (
    Day  = time.Hour * 24
    Year = Day * 365.25
)
```

In this code, `Day` is declared as `time.Hour * 24`, which is of type `time.Duration`. Then `Year` is declared as `Day * 365.25`. Since `Day` is of type `time.Duration`, `Year` is also of type `time.Duration`.

So, you don't need to specify the type for `Year` explicitly. It's inferred from the type of `Day`.

jantonisito: Go does not buy
Year = Day \* 365.25

GitHub Copilot: You're correct, my apologies for the confusion. In Go, constants cannot have a floating-point type unless they're explicitly declared as such. The multiplication of `Day` with `365.25` results in a floating-point number, which is not automatically converted to `time.Duration`.

Here's the corrected code:

```go
const (
    Day  = time.Hour * 24
    Year = Day * 365 // Leap years are not accounted for in this calculation
)
```

In this code, `Year` is calculated as `Day * 365`, which is an integer multiplication, so it's compatible with `time.Duration`. Please note that this calculation does not account for leap years. If you need to account for leap years, you'll need to handle this separately.

jantonisito: hmmm... you are quite right that without starting dat the conversion of time duration to years is not possible if we want to include lap year

GitHub Copilot: Yes, you're correct. The length of a year can vary due to leap years. If you need to convert a duration to years and you want to account for leap years, you'll need to know the starting date.

Here's an example of how you can do this:

```go
func formatDuration(start time.Time, d time.Duration) string {
    end := start.Add(d)

    years := end.Year() - start.Year()

    start = start.AddDate(years, 0, 0)
    days := end.Sub(start).Hours() / 24

    start = start.AddDate(0, 0, int(days))
    hours := end.Sub(start).Hours()

    start = start.Add(time.Duration(hours) * time.Hour)
    minutes := end.Sub(start).Minutes()

    start = start.Add(time.Duration(minutes) * time.Minute)
    seconds := end.Sub(start).Seconds()

    return fmt.Sprintf("%d years, %.0f days, %.0f hours, %.0f minutes, %.0f seconds", years, days, hours, minutes, seconds)
}
```

In this function, `start` is the starting date and `d` is the duration. The function first calculates the number of years by subtracting the year of the start date from the year of the end date. Then it calculates the remaining days, hours, minutes, and seconds. The function returns a string formatted as years, days, hours, minutes, and seconds.
