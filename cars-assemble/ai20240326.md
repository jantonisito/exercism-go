jantonisito: How big is `uint` in Go?

GitHub Copilot: In Go, the size of `uint` depends on the system the code is being run on. On a 32-bit system, `uint` is 32 bits, and on a 64-bit system, `uint` is 64 bits.

jantonisito: What is `testing.T` type passet to `Test....` func?

GitHub Copilot: `testing.T` is a type provided by Go's testing package. It's used to manage and report the state of a test or a related group of tests.

When you write a test function, you typically take a pointer to `testing.T` as a parameter. This provides methods for reporting test failures and logging additional information. For example, you can use `t.Fail()`, `t.Error()`, `t.Fatal()`, and `t.Log()` methods among others.

jantonisito: how does t.Error - which seems to be variadic - know whether to pass or fail?

GitHub Copilot: The `t.Error` function in Go's testing package does not determine whether a test passes or fails based on its arguments. Instead, it provides a way to log error messages. When `t.Error` is called, it marks the test as failed but allows execution to continue.

The arguments to `t.Error` are handled the same way as `fmt.Print`. They are converted to strings (if they aren't already) and then concatenated with spaces between them to form the error message.

If you want to mark a test as failed and stop its execution immediately, you can use `t.Fatal` or its variants. These work similarly to `t.Error`, but they also call `t.FailNow`, which stops the test immediately.
