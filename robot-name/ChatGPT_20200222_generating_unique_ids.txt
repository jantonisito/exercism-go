I have a Golang question. I am writing a program that needs to generate unique ISd on demand. I know how to do the random part but I presume I need to store the IDs that were already used in some persistent form. What is the idiomatic pattern to do it in Go ? Assume we do not have access to database. My initial reaction is to have a simple `seen map[string]bool` that would be serialized to a file on disk and loaded if needed. What is your take?

Your initial reaction to use a map to keep track of already generated IDs and to serialize it to a file on disk is a reasonable approach to solving this problem in Go. Using a map allows for efficient lookups and updates, while serializing it to disk allows you to persist the data between program runs.

Here are some tips on how to implement this approach in a more idiomatic way in Go:

Use the encoding/json package to serialize and deserialize the map to JSON format. This is a built-in package in Go and provides a simple way to work with JSON data. For example, to serialize the map, you could use the following code:
go
Copy code
import (
    "encoding/json"
    "os"
)

// ...

seen := make(map[string]bool)
// ... code to add items to the map ...

file, err := os.Create("seen.json")
if err != nil {
    // handle error
}
defer file.Close()

encoder := json.NewEncoder(file)
err = encoder.Encode(seen)
if err != nil {
    // handle error
}


When reading the map from disk, use the os.Open function to open the file, and then use json.NewDecoder to deserialize the JSON data into the map. For example:
go
Copy code
file, err := os.Open("seen.json")
if err != nil {
    // handle error
}
defer file.Close()

decoder := json.NewDecoder(file)

var seen map[string]bool
err = decoder.Decode(&seen)
if err != nil {
    // handle error
}
To ensure that the map is not accessed concurrently by multiple goroutines, you should use Go's built-in sync package to protect the map with a mutex. For example:
go
Copy code
import "sync"

// ...

type IDGenerator struct {
    seen map[string]bool
    mutex sync.Mutex
}

func (g *IDGenerator) Generate() string {
    g.mutex.Lock()
    defer g.mutex.Unlock()

    // ... generate the ID ...

    // add the ID to the map
    g.seen[id] = true

    // ... return the ID ...
}
By using a mutex to protect the map, you can ensure that only one goroutine at a time can access the map and update it. This helps prevent race conditions and data corruption.

Overall, your approach to use a map and serialize it to disk is a good one, and the tips I provided above should help you implement it in a more idiomatic way in Go.

Do you have any other suggestions? Any "uuid" type of built functionality in Go?
Yes, Go has a built-in package github.com/google/uuid that provides a type for UUIDs, as well as functions for generating and parsing UUIDs.

Here's an example of how you could use this package to generate unique IDs on demand:

go
Copy code
import "github.com/google/uuid"

func GenerateID() string {
    id := uuid.New().String()
    // ... code to check if the ID has been used before ...
    return id
}
The uuid.New() function generates a new UUID, and String() converts it to a string representation. You can then use your own code to check if the ID has been used before, as you mentioned in your original question.

Using a UUID library like this can have some advantages over using a simple counter or hash-based approach, as UUIDs are designed to be globally unique, even across different systems and networks. However, keep in mind that UUIDs are longer and more complex than simple counters or hashes, which may affect performance and memory usage if you need to generate and store a large number of them.

My IDs have specifc and short format so it is assumed that at some point there will be a clash. 
I see. In that case, you might want to consider using a different approach to generate unique IDs. One common technique is to use a combination of a random component and a sequential component.

For example, you could generate a random number using Go's built-in math/rand package, and then append a sequential number that is incremented every time you generate a new ID. This would give you a sequence of IDs that are unique, but still follow a specific format.

Here's an example implementation:

go
Copy code
import (
    "fmt"
    "math/rand"
    "time"
)

type IDGenerator struct {
    prefix string
    count  int
}

func NewIDGenerator(prefix string) *IDGenerator {
    rand.Seed(time.Now().UnixNano())
    return &IDGenerator{prefix: prefix, count: 0}
}

func (g *IDGenerator) Generate() string {
    random := rand.Intn(1000) // Generate a random number between 0 and 999
    id := fmt.Sprintf("%s-%03d-%d", g.prefix, random, g.count)
    g.count++
    return id
}
In this example, the NewIDGenerator function takes a prefix string as input, and initializes a new IDGenerator with a count of 0. The Generate method generates a random number between 0 and 999, and then formats the ID as "{prefix}-{random}-{count}". The count is incremented every time an ID is generated, ensuring that each ID is unique.

You can then use this IDGenerator to generate unique IDs on demand, while still following a specific format. Note that this approach is not guaranteed to produce globally unique IDs, so if you need to ensure global uniqueness, you may want to consider using a different approach, such as a UUID library or a distributed ID generation service.

Yeah the IDs need to be unique between invocations of testing functions - so there has to be persistence
In that case, you can still use a similar approach to the one I described earlier, but you'll need to persist the state of the IDGenerator between invocations of your testing functions. Here's an example implementation that uses a simple file-based persistence mechanism:

go
Copy code
import (
    "bufio"
    "fmt"
    "math/rand"
    "os"
    "strconv"
)

type IDGenerator struct {
    prefix string
    count  int
}

func NewIDGenerator(prefix string) (*IDGenerator, error) {
    rand.Seed(time.Now().UnixNano())
    generator := &IDGenerator{prefix: prefix, count: 0}
    if err := generator.load(); err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    return generator, nil
}

func (g *IDGenerator) Generate() (string, error) {
    random := rand.Intn(1000) // Generate a random number between 0 and 999
    id := fmt.Sprintf("%s-%03d-%d", g.prefix, random, g.count)
    g.count++
    if err := g.save(); err != nil {
        return "", err
    }
    return id, nil
}

func (g *IDGenerator) load() error {
    file, err := os.Open(g.filename())
    if err != nil {
        if os.IsNotExist(err) {
            return nil // Ignore "file not found" error
        }
        return err
    }
    defer file.Close()
    scanner := bufio.NewScanner(file)
    scanner.Scan()
    count, err := strconv.Atoi(scanner.Text())
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }
    g.count = count
    return nil
}

func (g *IDGenerator) save() error {
    file, err := os.Create(g.filename())
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }
    defer file.Close()
    fmt.Fprintln(file, g.count)
    return nil
}

func (g *IDGenerator) filename() string {
    return fmt.Sprintf("%s.txt", g.prefix)
}
In this example, the IDGenerator is initialized with a prefix string, and the load method is called to load the current count from a file on disk. If the file doesn't exist, the count is initialized to 0. When an ID is generated with the Generate method, the count is incremented and then saved back to the file using the save method.

Note that this example uses a very simple file-based persistence mechanism, which may not be suitable for high-concurrency scenarios or scenarios where multiple processes need to share the same state. If you need a more robust solution, you may want to consider using a database or distributed key-value store instead.
