OK - Kala Antique Copper (baritone) just landed.



First (and very quick) impressions:

1. it is SMALL! at first I thought they sent me a tenor.

Body is definitely smaller than baritone. Scale is 19".

Small size is probably good for the weight consideration.



2. Nut is narrow - 1.375" - it is not impossible tp play fingerstyle but you feel cramped.



3. Tone.... hmm. I am not sure I like Nylagut strings it came with - they are dark and flabby.

Makes me wonder if for that type of instrument (resonator) the tenor size would be a better

choice - more aligned with natural frequencies of the cone. Not a lot of sustain but sufficient.

Here are two demos from Kala site - side by side - to me baritone may be warm but it is muddy.

Tenor seems to have more "bite".

4. Playability - OK - you can play it all the way up the neck - no problem.

Narrow nut makes it more into strummer machine - maybe I can adjust to it fingerstyle.

No buzz or dead spots on first 15 frets - nice!



5. Pickup - kinda weak - I guess that is normal for passive ones.



6. WHAT NO STRAP BUTTON? Are you kidding Kala?? This is not a light instrument - it

absolutely needs a strap. Not sure how to go about it - drilling in metal body is not a

problem but then it is unknown if there is enough space between the cone and the

body to have a screw or bolt to mount a button. Big minus.



7. Changing strings will be weird - it seems that strings currently in have ball end.

There is not enough opening to use plastic 3-hole beads - tying metal rings (from

steel strings) will be be interesting juggling act. One may as well put steel strings on.

It has a truss rod so it is not impossible.



8. Loudness - yeah, it is on a loud side but not excessively. The muddiness of baritone

(with current string set) kills that a bit.

 

Overall it seems a OK - not exactly what I was expecting. I will record sample later.

If I decide to keep it I may try low tension steel strings on it.
