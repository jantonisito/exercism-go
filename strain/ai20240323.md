GitHub Copilot: This Go code is part of a package named `strain`. It defines three types: [`Ints`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolInFile?%5B%22strain.go%22%2C%22Ints%22%5D "strain.go"), [`Lists`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolInFile?%5B%22strain.go%22%2C%22Lists%22%5D "strain.go"), and [`Strings`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolInFile?%5B%22strain.go%22%2C%22Strings%22%5D "strain.go"), which are slices of `int`, slices of slices of `int`, and slices of `string`, respectively.

The `Keep` and `Discard` methods are defined on the [`Ints`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolInFile?%5B%22strain.go%22%2C%22Ints%22%5D "strain.go") type. Both methods take a function as an argument, which itself takes an `int` and returns a `bool`. This function is used as a filter to decide which elements to keep or discard.

In the `Keep` method, a new [`Ints`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolInFile?%5B%22strain.go%22%2C%22Ints%22%5D "strain.go") slice is created. The method then iterates over the elements of the original [`Ints`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolInFile?%5B%22strain.go%22%2C%22Ints%22%5D "strain.go") slice. If the filter function returns `true` for an element, that element is appended to the new slice. If the new slice is empty after this process, `nil` is returned; otherwise, the new slice is returned.

The `Discard` method works similarly, but it appends an element to the new slice if the filter function returns `false`.

The `Keep` method is also defined on the [`Lists`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolInFile?%5B%22strain.go%22%2C%22Lists%22%5D "strain.go") and [`Strings`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolInFile?%5B%22strain.go%22%2C%22Strings%22%5D "strain.go") types, working in the same way as it does for [`Ints`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolInFile?%5B%22strain.go%22%2C%22Ints%22%5D "strain.go"), but with the filter function taking a slice of `int` and a `string`, respectively.

The commented-out line at the end suggests that a solution using Go's upcoming generics feature might be planned. This would allow for a more general implementation of the `Keep` and `Discard` methods, reducing code duplication.

jantonisito: can you explain the syntax for me?
`
func (i Ints) Keep(filter func(int) bool) Ints`

GitHub Copilot: This line of code in Go defines a method named `Keep` on the type `Ints`. Here's a breakdown of the syntax:

- `func`: This keyword is used to declare a function.

- `(i Ints)`: This is the receiver of the method. A method receiver is similar to the `this` keyword in other languages. It allows the method to be called on variables that are of the type `Ints`. The variable `i` is the instance of `Ints` that the `Keep` method is being called on.

- `Keep`: This is the name of the method.

- `(filter func(int) bool)`: This is the parameter that the `Keep` method takes. The parameter `filter` is a function that itself takes an `int` as a parameter and returns a `bool`.

- `Ints`: This is the return type of the `Keep` method. The method returns a value of type `Ints`.

So, in summary, this line of code defines a method named `Keep` on the type `Ints` that takes a function as a parameter and returns a value of type `Ints`. The parameter function takes an `int` and returns a `bool`.

jantonisito: does go have classes?

GitHub Copilot: No, Go does not have classes in the traditional sense like in languages such as Java or C++. Instead, Go has types and allows methods to be associated with these types. This is similar to how methods are associated with classes in other languages, but without some of the features typically associated with classes, such as inheritance.

In Go, you can define a type and then define methods on that type. For example, in the code you provided, `Ints` is a type (a slice of integers), and `Keep` is a method defined on that type. This allows you to call the `Keep` method on any variable of type `Ints`.

This approach in Go encourages composition over inheritance, which is a common design principle in the Go community.

jantonisito: can you elaborate on that las sentence?

GitHub Copilot: Sure, the principle of "composition over inheritance" is a fundamental design principle in object-oriented programming. It suggests that it is more beneficial to build complex objects by combining simple ones, rather than extending a base or parent class with new functionality.

Inheritance is a way of reusing code by extending or modifying the behavior of a parent class into a child class. However, it can lead to problems when the hierarchy becomes complex, and it can be difficult to change the behavior of a class without affecting the classes that inherit from it.

Composition, on the other hand, involves building complex objects by combining simpler ones. This is often done by having objects that use other objects, rather than inheriting from a parent class. This can lead to more flexibility, as objects can be easily swapped out for others with the same interface, and it can be easier to change the behavior of one object without affecting others.

In the context of Go, this principle is reflected in the language's design. Go does not support traditional class-based inheritance. Instead, it encourages the use of interfaces and embedding to achieve polymorphism and code reuse. This can lead to simpler and more flexible code structures.

jantonisito: can you give me a primer on intefaces in go?

GitHub Copilot: Sure, in Go, an interface is a collection of method signatures. It's a way to specify the behavior of an object. If a type provides the methods defined in an interface, we say that the type implements the interface.

Here's a basic example:

```go
type Shape interface {
    Area() float64
}
```

In this example, `Shape` is an interface that has one method, `Area`, which returns a `float64`.

Now, let's say we have two types, `Circle` and `Rectangle`. If we want these types to implement the `Shape` interface, they need to define the `Area` method.

```go
type Circle struct {
    Radius float64
}

func (c Circle) Area() float64 {
    return math.Pi * c.Radius * c.Radius
}

type Rectangle struct {
    Width, Height float64
}

func (r Rectangle) Area() float64 {
    return r.Width * r.Height
}
```

In this code, both `Circle` and `Rectangle` implement the `Shape` interface because they have an `Area` method with the same signature as defined in the `Shape` interface.

One of the main benefits of interfaces in Go is that they allow for polymorphism. You can write functions that operate on the interface type, and they can accept any value that implements the interface. For example:

```go
func printArea(s Shape) {
    fmt.Println(s.Area())
}

c := Circle{Radius: 5}
r := Rectangle{Width: 3, Height: 4}

printArea(c) // prints the area of the circle
printArea(r) // prints the area of the rectangle
```

In this example, `printArea` can accept any type that implements the `Shape` interface. This allows us to use `printArea` with both `Circle` and `Rectangle` types.

jantonisito: I see - so polymorphism without inheritance - what happens if printArea us called on object the does not implement the interface Shape - compile time orrt error?

GitHub Copilot: In Go, if you try to call the `printArea` function with an argument that does not implement the `Shape` interface, you will get a compile-time error. This is because Go is a statically typed language, which means that type checking is done at compile time, not at runtime.

For example, if you have a type `Square` that does not implement the `Area` method:

```go
type Square struct {
    SideLength float64
}
```

And you try to call `printArea` with a `Square`:

```go
s := Square{SideLength: 5}
printArea(s) // This will cause a compile-time error
```

You will get a compile-time error similar to this:

```
cannot use s (type Square) as type Shape in argument to printArea:
	Square does not implement Shape (missing Area method)
```

This error message is saying that you can't use a `Square` as a `Shape` because `Square` does not implement the `Area` method required by the `Shape` interface.

jantonisito: so `Ints []int` is basically an alias to ``[]int` that is what subsequent `make(Ints, 0)` works?

GitHub Copilot: Yes, that's correct. In Go, you can create type aliases using the `type` keyword. In this case, `Ints` is a type alias for `[]int`, which is a slice of integers.

This means that wherever you can use `[]int`, you can also use `Ints`. So when you do `make(Ints, 0)`, it's equivalent to doing `make([]int, 0)`. This creates a new slice of integers with a length of 0.

By creating a type alias, you can also define methods on that type, as is done in the `Keep` and `Discard` methods in your code. This wouldn't be possible with just `[]int`, as you can't define methods on built-in types in Go.

jantonisito: can you explain the term "slice"

GitHub Copilot: In Go, a slice is a dynamically-sized, flexible view into the elements of an array. In simple terms, it's a sequence of array elements.

Here's a breakdown of the key characteristics of slices:

- **Length and Capacity**: A slice has both a length and a capacity. The length of a slice is the number of elements it contains. The capacity of a slice is the number of elements in the underlying array, counting from the first element in the slice.

- **Zero Value of Slices**: The zero value of a slice is `nil`. A `nil` slice has a length and capacity of 0 and has no underlying array.

- **Creating Slices**: Slices can be created with the built-in `make` function; this is how you create dynamically-sized arrays. The `make` function allocates a zeroed array and returns a slice that refers to that array.

Here's an example of a slice:

```go
primes := []int{2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13}
```

In this example, `primes` is a slice that includes six integers. You can access the elements in the slice just like you would with an array:

```go
fmt.Println(primes[0]) // prints: 2
fmt.Println(primes[1]) // prints: 3
```

You can also change the elements in the slice:

```go
primes[0] = 1
fmt.Println(primes[0]) // prints: 1
```

Slices are more common in Go than arrays because they are more flexible.

jantonisito: so array has a static size?

GitHub Copilot: Yes, in Go, arrays have a fixed size. Once you declare an array with a certain size, you can't change its size. Here's an example of an array declaration:

```go
var arr [5]int
```

In this example, `arr` is an array of 5 integers. You can't add a sixth element to this array.

On the other hand, slices, which are built on top of arrays, are dynamic. You can append elements to a slice and it will grow as needed. Here's an example:

```go
var s []int
s = append(s, 1) // s now has one element
```

In this example, `s` is a slice of integers. Initially, it has no elements. But when you append an element to it, it grows to accommodate the new element. You can continue appending elements and `s` will keep growing as needed.

jantonisito: the price I suspect is that slice live on a heap vs arrays on the stack?

GitHub Copilot: In Go, whether a slice or an array is allocated on the heap or the stack is not determined by the type itself (slice or array), but rather how and where they are used. The Go runtime, more specifically the garbage collector, decides whether to put the memory on the heap or the stack.

Generally, if the Go compiler can prove that the variable is not referenced after the function returns, then the compiler can allocate the variable on the stack. Otherwise, it is allocated on the heap.

However, it's important to note that slices are essentially a descriptor of an array segment, not an array itself. A slice consists of a pointer to the array, the length of the segment, and its capacity (the maximum length of the segment). The actual data of the slice (the underlying array) is stored separately from this descriptor, and can be on the heap even if the slice header is on the stack.

In practice, you usually don't need to worry about whether your data is on the heap or stack in Go. The Go runtime takes care of this for you. It's one of the advantages of working with a garbage collected language like Go.

jantonisito: very nice elaboration! thank you, Copilot!
