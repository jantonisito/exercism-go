jantonisito: Can the code

```
func IsIsogram(phrase string) bool {
	return IsIsogram3(phrase)
}
```

be simply written as
`IsIsogram = IsIsogram3` ?

GitHub Copilot: No, in Go, you cannot simply assign one function to another like `IsIsogram = IsIsogram3`. Go is statically typed and does not support this kind of function aliasing. The function `IsIsogram` needs to be defined with its own function body. The code you provided is a valid way to make `IsIsogram` behave the same as `IsIsogram3`.

jantonisito: can you do it in Rust?

GitHub Copilot: In Rust, you can create a type alias for a function type, but you cannot directly assign one function to another like `IsIsogram = IsIsogram3`. However, you can create a new function `is_isogram` that wraps the call to `is_isogram3` like so:

```rust
fn is_isogram(phrase: &str) -> bool {
    is_isogram3(phrase)
}
```

This is similar to what you're doing in the Go code. The function `is_isogram` takes a string slice and returns a boolean, and all it does is call `is_isogram3` with the same argument and return its result.

			return false
		}
		// if no match we shift and flip the bit
		letterFlags |= (1 << dif)
	}
	return tru
```

GitHub Copilot: The provided Go code defines a function [`IsIsogram3`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolInFile?%5B%22code%2Fisogram.go%22%2C%22IsIsogram3%22%5D "code/isogram.go") that checks if a given phrase is an isogram. An isogram is a word or phrase without a repeating letter.

The function takes a string `phrase` as an argument and returns a boolean value indicating whether the phrase is an isogram or not.

First, it calculates the length of the phrase and stores it in `theEnd`. It also initializes a `uint32` variable `letterFlags` to 0. This variable will be used as a bit mask to track the occurrence of letters in the phrase.

Then, it declares two `uint8` variables, `letter` and `dif`.

The function then enters a loop that iterates over each character in the phrase. For each character, it checks if it's a lowercase or uppercase English letter. If it's a lowercase letter (ASCII value between 97 and 122), it subtracts the ASCII value of 'a' from the letter's ASCII value to get a value `dif` between 0 and 25. If it's an uppercase letter (ASCII value between 65 and 90), it subtracts the ASCII value of 'A' to get the same `dif`. If the character is not an English letter, it skips to the next iteration.

Next, it checks if the bit at the position `dif` in `letterFlags` is set. If it is, that means the letter has appeared before, so it returns `false` indicating the phrase is not an isogram.

If the bit is not set, it sets the bit at the position `dif` in `letterFlags` using a bitwise OR operation. This marks that the letter has been encountered.

After checking all the letters, if no repeating letter is found, it returns `true` indicating the phrase is an isogram.

Please note that there seems to be a typo in the return statement. It should be `return true` instead of `return tru`.

jantonisito: is this a common idea (using bit flip instead of say hashmap)?

GitHub Copilot: Yes, using a bit vector or bit mask, like in this code, is a common technique in programming for efficiently checking if an item exists in a set. It's especially useful when the set of possible items is small and can fit in an integer type, like the 26 English letters in this case.

This technique uses less memory than a hashmap and can be faster due to the efficient bitwise operations. However, it's less flexible and harder to understand than a hashmap. It only works when the set of possible items is small and can be mapped to integer indices, and it doesn't handle collisions like a hashmap does.

In this case, the bit vector is a good choice because it's efficient and the problem is simple enough that the limitations of the bit vector don't matter. But for more complex problems, a hashmap or other data structure might be a better choice.

```go
// IsIsogram check is string is an isogram (no repeated chars)
func IsIsogram2(phrase string) bool {
	phrase = strings.ToLower(phrase)

	for i, char := range phrase {
		if unicode.IsLetter(char) && strings.ContainsRune(phrase[:i], char) {
			return false
		}
	}
	return true
}
```

GitHub Copilot: The provided Go code defines a function [`IsIsogram2`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolInFile?%5B%22code%2Fisogram.go%22%2C%22IsIsogram2%22%5D "code/isogram.go") that checks if a given phrase is an isogram. An isogram is a word or phrase without a repeating letter, regardless of case.

The function takes a string `phrase` as an argument and returns a boolean value indicating whether the phrase is an isogram or not.

First, it converts the entire phrase to lowercase using the `strings.ToLower` function. This is done to make the function case-insensitive, as isograms are typically case-insensitive.

Then, it enters a loop that iterates over each character in the phrase. For each character, it checks two conditions: if the character is a letter and if the character has appeared before in the phrase.

The `unicode.IsLetter` function checks if the character is a letter. The `strings.ContainsRune` function checks if the character exists in the substring of the phrase up to the current character. The substring `phrase[:i]` includes all characters in the phrase before the current character.

If both conditions are true, that means the letter has appeared before, so it returns `false` indicating the phrase is not an isogram.

If it checks all the letters and finds no repeating letter, it returns `true` indicating the phrase is an isogram.

This function uses the built-in string and unicode functions in Go, which makes it easy to understand and use. However, it's not the most efficient solution because `strings.ContainsRune` has to scan the substring for each character, resulting in a time complexity of O(n^2) for a phrase of length n.

jantonisito: Correct - that is not good solution

GitHub Copilot: Indeed, while the function `IsIsogram2` is correct and easy to understand, it is not the most efficient solution due to its O(n^2) time complexity. This is because for each character in the phrase, it checks if it exists in the substring of the phrase before the current character, which takes O(n) time, resulting in O(n^2) time for the whole phrase.

A more efficient solution would be to use a data structure like a set or a map to keep track of the letters that have been encountered. This would allow checking for duplicate letters in constant time, resulting in an overall time complexity of O(n) for the function. Here's an example of how you could implement this in Go:

```go
func IsIsogram(phrase string) bool {
	phrase = strings.ToLower(phrase)
	seen := make(map[rune]bool)

	for _, char := range phrase {
		if unicode.IsLetter(char) {
			if seen[char] {
				return false
			}
			seen[char] = true
		}
	}
	return true
}
```

In this version of the function, a map `seen` is used to keep track of the letters that have been encountered. For each letter in the phrase, if it's already in the map, the function returns `false`. Otherwise, it adds the letter to the map. This ensures that each letter is only checked once, greatly improving the efficiency of the function.

jantonisito: funny but that is is almost verbatim my first solution

```
func IsIsogram1(s string) bool {
	//hash based solution
	check := make(map[rune]int)
	for _, ch := range strings.ToLower(s) {
		if unicode.IsLetter(ch) {
			_, ok := check[ch]
			if ok {
				return false
			} else {
				check[ch] = 1
			}
		}
	}
	return true
}
```

GitHub Copilot: That's great! Your solution is indeed a common and efficient way to solve this problem. It uses a hashmap to keep track of the occurrence of each character in the string.

Here's a brief explanation of how it works:

The function `IsIsogram1` takes a string `s` as an argument and returns a boolean value indicating whether the string is an isogram or not.

First, it creates a hashmap `check` to store each character in the string as a key and its occurrence as a value.

Then, it converts the string to lowercase using `strings.ToLower(s)` to ensure the function is case-insensitive.

Next, it enters a loop that iterates over each character in the string. For each character, it checks if it's a letter using `unicode.IsLetter(ch)`. If it's not a letter, it skips to the next iteration.

If the character is a letter, it checks if the character is already in the hashmap using `_, ok := check[ch]`. If the character is in the hashmap (`ok` is true), that means the character has appeared before, so it returns `false` indicating the string is not an isogram.

If the character is not in the hashmap, it adds the character to the hashmap with a value of 1 using `check[ch] = 1`.

After checking all the characters, if no repeating letter is found, it returns `true` indicating the string is an isogram.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n) for a string of length n, which is much more efficient than the O(n^2) solution using `strings.ContainsRune`.

jantonisito: I think though make map bool instead of int is better choice

GitHub Copilot: Yes, you're correct. Since you're only interested in whether a character has been seen before or not, a `map[rune]bool` would be a more appropriate choice. This way, you can simply check if a character is in the map to determine if it has been seen before, and you can add a character to the map by setting its value to `true`. Here's how you could modify your function:

```go
func IsIsogram1(s string) bool {
	seen := make(map[rune]bool)
	for _, ch := range strings.ToLower(s) {
		if unicode.IsLetter(ch) {
			if seen[ch] {
				return false
			}
			seen[ch] = true
		}
	}
	return true
}
```

This version of the function works the same way as your original function, but it uses a `map[rune]bool` instead of a `map[rune]int`, which makes it slightly more efficient and easier to understand.

jantonisito: so you think that that `_, ok := seen[ch]` is spurious ?

GitHub Copilot: In the context of a `map[rune]bool`, the line `_, ok := seen[ch]` is indeed unnecessary. When you access a map in Go with a key that does not exist, it returns the zero value for the map's value type. For a `bool`, this zero value is `false`.

So, if `ch` is not in the map `seen`, `seen[ch]` will return `false`, which is exactly what you want. Therefore, you can simplify your code by removing the `_, ok := seen[ch]` line and directly checking `if seen[ch]`.

Here's how you can modify your function:

```go
func IsIsogram1(s string) bool {
	seen := make(map[rune]bool)
	for _, ch := range strings.ToLower(s) {
		if unicode.IsLetter(ch) {
			if seen[ch] {
				return false
			}
			seen[ch] = true
		}
	}
	return true
}
```

In this version of the function, `if seen[ch]` will be `true` if `ch` is in the map and `false` otherwise, which is exactly what you want.
